I'm normally blowing glass and have been a self employed artist for 25 yrs but currently am enjoying a life pivot into studying full stack web development at [Alchemy Code Lab](https://www.alchemycodelab.com/). I'll be working on finishing up school in the coming months and will be looking for web dev work by April! Please reach out with any comments or questions.
